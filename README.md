In this project, I implemented the physical layer (PHY) of the well-known WLAN standard on both MATLAB and HDL platform. The implemented design in each section synthesized and verified on a Virtex-6 FPGA. This project was based on the 802.11a and the goal was to implement the transmitter and receiver side of this standard.
